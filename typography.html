  <body>
    This isn't the paragraph, but will have 24px font size
    <p>
      This IS a paragraph and is at mercy to whatever I program p tags to do. It
      is 2em, which means it's at double the set font size, which means this is
      48px font size.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also use
      <span class="keypoint1">bold</span> and
      <span class="keypoint2">italics</span>
    </p>
